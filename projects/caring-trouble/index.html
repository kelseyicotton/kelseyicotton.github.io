Specifically, our framework engages with speculative feminism; matters of fact, concern and care; and feminist data ethics. This framework–when applied to the analysis of an AI artwork or artistic application of an AI tool–is intended to assist in identifying what is <em>visibilised</em> and <em>invisilised</em> by the usage of AI.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mofcc.pick-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mofcc.pick-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mofcc.pick-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/mofcc.pick.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="The Caring Trouble Analytical Framework" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The Caring Trouble Analytical Framework. </div> </body></html>
