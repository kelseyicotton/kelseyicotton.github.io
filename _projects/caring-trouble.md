The Caring Trouble Analytical Framework is an interdisciplinary tool for analysing and revealing the (in)visibilised facts and concerns embedded in AI Artworks.

This framework draws from interdisciplinary theory from science and technology studies (STS), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and AI ethics. Specifically, our framework engages with speculative feminism; matters of fact, concern and care; and feminist data ethics. This framework--when applied to the analysis of an AI artwork or artistic application of an AI tool--is intended to assist in identifying what is *visibilised* and *invisilised* by the usage of AI.
